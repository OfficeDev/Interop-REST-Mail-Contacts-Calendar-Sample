###Install Android SDK

The Android SDK can be downloaded from the Android Developer site [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). You may also need to install the [Java SE Development Kit 7u80](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). If you have questions about installing the Java SDK, you can refer to this [tutorial](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-the-Java-Software-Development-Kit).

##Visual Studio Emulator Configuration

Android Studio comes with its own Android emulator, but Microsoft has designed an emulator focused on performance, speed, and efficiency that can be used independently or in conjunction with Visual Studio 2015. You can learn more about the Visual Studio Emulator for Android [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2014/516).

###Install Visual Studio Android Emulator

The Visual Studio Emulator for Android does not require you to download and/or use Visual Studio, but if you would like to use the free (Community) or paid (Enterprise) Visual Studio, you can download and install Visual Studio Community or Visual Studio Enterprise from the [Visual Studio Website](https://www.visualstudio.com/). Whichever version you choose, it must be Visual Studio 2015 in order to run the emulator.

Download and install the [Visual Studio Emulator for Android](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/msft-android-emulator-vs.aspx).

###Launch the App in Visual Studio Android Emulator

There are 2 ways to launch the Visual Studio Android Emulator, as a stand-alone emulator and through Visual Studio. Which way you want to use the emulator determines how you start it, but after that the steps are the same.

####As a Stand-Alone Emulator

To launch the Visual Studio Android Emulator as a stand-alone emulator, click on the Start menu and search for "emulator" and select "Visual Studio Emulator for Android"

![launch visual studio android emulator](../img/vs-emulator-start.jpg)

####As Part of Visual Studio

To launch the Visual Studio Android Emulator as part of Visual Studio, click on the Start menu and search for "Visual Studio" and click on "Visual Studio 2015"

![launch visual studio](../img/vs-start.jpg)

1. Once the emulator has started choose a device by clicking the green triangle next to your choice.
  
  ![choose a device](../img/vs-emulator-choose-device.jpg)

2. When you have chosen a device, open your project in Android Studio and start your app using steps [3 - 4 in the Android Configuration](#step3) section above.

3. After running your app, instead of choosing to launch the emulator, select "Choose a running device" and then select a device using the VS Emulator then click "OK".
