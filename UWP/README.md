# Interop REST Mail Contacts Calendar App for the Universal Windows Platform

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) allows developers to build their apps for a wide range of devices including mobile, desktop, HoloLens, Surface Hub, and Xbox. You can learn more about the Universal Windows Platform on the [UWP Quick Start Guide](http://microsoft.github.io/UWPQuickStart/index.html#). 

Before you begin, you need to register your app with an Office 365 Developer account. The directions for registering are in the [README.md file in the root of this repo](../README.md).

##Install Visual Studio

In order to build the app for the Universal Windows Platform, you need to install Visual Studio 2015 Community (free) or Enterprise (paid). You can download Visual Studio 2015 Community or Enterprise from the [Visual Studio Website](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

##Windows UWP Configuration

1. Download or clone The Interop REST Mail Calendar Android App from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Interop-REST-Mail-Contacts-Calendar-Sample).

2. Start Visual Studio.

3. To open the app, click **file** then hover over Open which will open a new menu and click **Project/Solution** or click **Open Project...** on the start page. Then navigate to the Meeting_Manager_UWP folder \Interop-REST-Mail-Contacts-Calendar-Sample\UWP\Meeting_Manager_UWP and open MeetingManager.sln:

5. In the App.xaml file, replace the ClientID with your Client ID, replace the RedirectUri with your Redirect URI and then replace the Domain with your developer tenant domain. For example, I used "https://greencricketcreations.onmicrosoft.com/MyUWPCalendarApp" for my Redirect URI, so my developer tenant domain is "greencricketcreations.onmicrosoft.com":
